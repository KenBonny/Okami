    My wife and I have a huge freezer. It's impossible to know what is exactly in there, how much of it is left, when it
    was frozen and most importantly, when it will expire. That is why I created this little site.

    Here, I can list all the items in my freezer, tag them with a category, provide an amount and choose a frozen and
    expiration date. The default frozen date is today and can only be a date in the past. The default expiration date is
    one year from now. The maximum expiration date is two years from now and cannot be a date in the past. Rows
    approaching expiration will be highlighted:
    - <span className="first-warning">Three months before expiry</span>
    - <span className="second-warning">A month before expiry</span>
    - <span className="expired">On and after expiry</span>

    When deleting items, they will not be automatically be deleted immediately. They will be kept for another month
    before actually being removed. It is possible to still see them by enabling the "_include deleted_" checkbox to the
    right of the search field.

    ## Signing in

    For privacy reasons, I don't want to keep any data in a database. I do want the items that are stored here to be persisted and accessible from different devices. That is why it is possible to log into your Google account and store the items from your freezer in your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/home). I do not require access to your entire Google Drive, this app just needs access to the files that it creates. That way, I cannot gain any access to your private documents, but you are in charge of your data. I save a file `okami-freezer-items.json` in the base directory. Please don't move or delete this file as it contains all your data from this site.

    ### Sign in again every hour

    Now for a slightly annoying topic: why do you need to sign in every hour. This is due to a technical limitation on my end. Most apps you use on the internet will have a frontend (namely the site you are looking at) and a backend (think of this as the back office of a company) where data gets processed. For example: Gmail's frontend shows you emails and lets you type your email; the backend makes sure that when you click send, the mail is delivered to it's recipients. This site does not have a backend.

    Why is this important? To ensure long lasting logins, I need to store some sensitive data in a secure place. A frontend is not a secure place in terms of computer security, that is where a backend would come in handy. Think of it as storing the badge you use to enter your workplace in the lobby of your workplace. This means that I cannot store the sensitive information needed to securely sign you in for extended periods of time without a backend.

    For the geeks among us: I'm using Googles OAuth implementation with the implicit flow. That means I get an access token back from the login popup/window. With this access token I can access the Google APIs, but the access token is limited in time for about an hour. If I want to use another flow, I would get a JWT or credential token, depending on the flow with refresh tokens. To use those, I'd need to exchange the credential or refresh tokens for access tokens. Exchanging them would mean setting up a backend to receive a callback from Google on a secure endpoint, which would require a backend. Storing the credential or refresh tokens securely would require a backend. As I do not want to go through the hassle of setting this all up and maintaining it, you'll have to live with the short-lived access tokens. If anybody has ideas on how to do this better, be my guest and open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/KenBonny/Okami/issues) or even better, submit a pull request.

    ## Bugs

    This brings me to the unfortunate topic of bugs. I've taken a lot of precautions to build software as bug-free as possible. As I'm still human and very much fallible, I am prone to mistakes. If you find any bugs, inconsistenties or would like to request new features, please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/KenBonny/Okami/issues) or even better, submit a pull request.

    As this is a hobby project, be patient as I'm maintaining this in my free time, free of charge.

    Worst case scenario, I'll refund you all the money you've paid me. 😉
